<h1 data-label="657543" class="ltx_title_section">General description</h1><div>There is a certain informational asymmetry: a person that can catch the non-collaborator can't directly observe him. So he has to rely on collaboration with those who have an information about the wrongdoer. Those who have an option to detect and inform the punishing authority about who commit the crime are called the whistleblowers later in the text.</div><div>When the central authority faces the such an issue with detection it can be interested in boosting the propensity of other members in the ingroup team (a team to which the perpetrator belongs to), to blow the whistle.</div><div>One of the possible solutions is to punish a random member of a group if no one detects the wrongdoer. This can be counted as collective sanctions (CS) where everyone in the group is punished by the 1/n-th of the total amount of punishment, where n is the size of the group.&nbsp;</div><div>There are several different considerations that can take place and affect the efficiency of this measure.</div><ol><li>The risk of being punished for non-whistleblowing if no one informs on the perpetrator decreases the opportunity cost of whistleblowing. Thus the introduction of CS will increase the frequency of whistleblowing.</li><li>The external authority may be unwilling to implement the random punishment if it does not observe who is guilty in the wrongdoing. Such a low propensity to use the CS will decrease the chance that the wrongdoer will be punished. If other members of the team would realize that the authority won't use its power to punish them for the silence they will abstain from blowing the whistle.</li></ol><h1 data-label="329682" class="ltx_title_section">More specific design description</h1><div>In its core there is a standard PGG with four players.&nbsp;</div><ul><li>There are three different roles:&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><blockquote class="au-no-left-border"><ol><li>The <b>perpetrator</b>: he is defined here as the The Least Contributor (TLC). A participant with the smallest contribution to a collective investment is chosen. If there are more than one smallest contributors in a group, the TLC is chosen randomly from them.</li><li><b>Sanctioning authority</b>: a random member from the group of non-perpetrators. If the TLC is detected &nbsp;(by other members of the group) he is able to apply a continuous (as in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citet{Nikiforakis_2005}</cite>) punishment which is costly for him.</li><li><b>Ingroup members</b>: the rest of the group apart from the perpetrator and a sanctioning authority. &nbsp;They make a binary decision about detection of the TLC. This decision is costly. If no one from the ingroup members take the decision to detect and inform the sanctioning authority about the identity of the TLC he cannot be directly punished by the sanctioning authority. If no whistleblowing takes place the rest depends on the specific treatment. &nbsp;Under&nbsp;<i>Individual Sanctions (IS)&nbsp;</i>the sanctioning authority can not further proceed with the punishment and the game ends. Under&nbsp;<i>Collective Sanctions (CS)&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;the sanctioning authority can choose either to skip the punishment or to punish a random member of the group.</li></ol></blockquote></blockquote><div>In order to collect as many data points as possible I use in this design the strategy method in role assignment.</div><div>The participants take the following decisions in order listed below:</div><ol><li>A participant takes the&nbsp;<b>binary</b> decision as if he is chosen as an ingroup member: whether he will detect the TLC so that the sanctioning authority &nbsp;or not.</li><li>A participant takes the&nbsp;<b>continuous&nbsp;</b>decision as if he is chosen as a sanctioning authority: whether he will punish the detected TLC (in case he will receive any information from the rest of the group) and by how much he will punish him, i.e. how many deduction tokens will be send to the TLC out of the additional endowment provided for punishment. Under&nbsp;<i>CS&nbsp;</i>treatment he also decides what will be his actions in case of no ireports the TLC from the</li><li></li></ol><div></div>
