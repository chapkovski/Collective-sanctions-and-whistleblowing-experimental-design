So he has to rely on collaboration with those who have an information about the wrongdoer. Those who have an option to detect and inform the punishing authority about who commit the crime are called the whistleblowers later in the text.</div><div>When the central authority faces the such an issue with detection it can be interested in boosting the propensity of other members in the ingroup team (a team to which the perpetrator belongs to), to blow the whistle.</div><div>One of the possible solutions is to punish a random member of a group if no one detects the wrongdoer. This can be counted as collective sanctions (CS) where everyone in the group is punished by the 1/n-th of the total amount of punishment, where n is the size of the group.&nbsp;</div><div>There are several different considerations that can take place and affect the efficiency of this measure.</div><ol><li>The risk of being punished for non-whistleblowing if no one informs on the perpetrator decreases the opportunity cost of whistleblowing.
